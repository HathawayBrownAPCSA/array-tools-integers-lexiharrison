This code technically works with the main() method that is written here ... 
BUT!
  There's one significant issue that could arise if you try to use this code elsewhere.
  getMinIndex and getMaxIndex only work if you have already run getMin and getMax (respectively).
  If you re-arrange the order of the code in main(), it will return 0 as the index of the
  min and max values every time.
    One solution is to add the loop transversal of the array in getMinIndex and getMaxIndex.
    Another solution is to have the Index methods call the Max/Min methods before returning a value.
  
  Better to write flexible code that can work in a variety of situations.

Also - instructions said to include javadoc comments with each method.
Yours are missing!  Please add them (including @return) and re-submit.

8/10 right now, 9/10 when resubmitted.

Update Jan. 26:  
  Issue #1 resolved
  Issue #2 not yet.  You have some simple comments, but they're not in javadoc format.
    They won't appear when you create the documentation of your code.
    Javadoc would start with /** and end with */ and should include @return for each method.
 Up to 8.5 / 10; keep going!
